# neural-network-challenge-1

## Overview
This project builds a neural network to predict student loan repayment success using a dataset of previous borrowers. The model helps refine interest rate predictions for a student loan refinancing company.

## Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess data, define features (`X`) and target (`y`), split the data into training and testing sets, and scale features.
2. **Model Compilation**: Build a deep neural network using TensorFlow, compile with binary cross-entropy, and evaluate the model.
3. **Prediction**: Load the saved model, make predictions, and generate a classification report.
4. **Recommendation System**: Discuss data for a student loan recommendation system, content-based filtering, and real-world challenges like data privacy and regulation.

## Sources
- Most of the code is based on the provided starter code and AI Bootcamp exercises.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yifei4905/neural-network-challenge-1.git
